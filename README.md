This project uses the [REUSE](https://reuse.software) standard in order
to communicate the correct licence for the file. For those unfamiliar
with the standard the licence for each file can be found in one of three
places. The licence will either be in a comment block at the top of the
file, in a `.license` file with the same name as the file, or in the
dep5 file located in the `.reuse` directory.
